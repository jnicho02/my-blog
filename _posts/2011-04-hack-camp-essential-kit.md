<p>I like to attend hack camps which are often up in 'that London', so it calls for an overnight stay. The pain can be lessened with some lightweight camping kit. <p /> * heavy duty wax earplugs <br />* cheap sleeping bag <br />* eyemask (from Boots) <br />* travel toothbrush <br />* small towel <br />* hiker's roll mat <p /> Don't count on there being soft things to sleep on, darkness or quiet. <p /> I've also been known to take my mega cheap Millets dome tent. They stand up without pegs and don't even need to be waterproof. I plan to be super-geeky and kit it out with a pico projector or LEDs.</p>
