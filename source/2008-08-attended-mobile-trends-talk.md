I went to a talk about the latest trends in mobile gaming.

##Great Animation
The latest trend is for big bold characters, large enough to be bold rather than shrunk to fit lots onto the screen.

##Cheeky touches.

##Different Palettes
The limitations of mobile have in effect freed designers from the console's shades-of-grey reality. Stark monochrome with flashes of colour can be effective in displaying characters.

##Stick Figures
Similarly, characters do not need to be realistically rendered. Stick figures made out of circles can be good. E.g. Xiao Xiao

##Star Ratings
A 5-star rating for a level taking account of speed, accuracy, etc. can make for a replayable game. Levels can be easy to complete, so as not to put off casual gamers, but hard to master. There needs to be a reward for achieving 5 stars.

##Unlockable Modes
Retro Chop Em Ups
e.g. Tetris Pop

e.g. Namco Arcade Golf: after finishing a hole, the player can play pacman for 30 seconds to earn a reward.

##Cool Physics
e.g. Sola Rola, Gish, Enigmo.

##Sandboxes
freeplay with no game target

##Genre Mashups
Including a traditional game (like a card game) as part of the game mechanic. People will already know how to play and remember the 'brand' e.g. Puzzle Quest, Creatures of the Deep.

##Contextual Controls
Using a single button that changes purpose depending on the current situation. e.g. Pro Evolution Soccer mobile.

##Pigs
Well, 'fun' anyway. e.g. Piglympics. You know what you're getting just by the name: pigs, doing olympic sports.

##Asynchronous Multiplayer
Turn-based spread out over time. E.g. Spore Origins, Anytime Pool for FaceBook.

##Simple Buttons, Complex Movements
A single button to control what happens, but has to be pressed at just the right time. e.g. Kimikaze Robots.

##Motion Puzzlers
Using the tilt detection powers of the device e.g. stuff on the iPhone

##Touchscreen Only Controls
e.g. The iPhone. Lots of lessons can be learn from the DS Lite

##Whack-a-mole Control
The screen real estate is divided into 9 and the keypad buttons correspond to that sector to control where you fire a gun at say. With a bit of thought, this can be made interesting.

##Level Editors
Create and share. Remember the 'YouTube rule' that 2% of people are creators and 98% of people are consumers. E.g. Boom Blox

##Pre-rendered 3D
Playing the game on top of a photorealistic background. e.g. Table Tennis Star. This can look great and really stand out from the crowd as long as the gameplay is good.

##Friend Rankings
The league table should be of people that you know, not the whole world.

##Achievements/Feats
##Skins/Avatars/Unlockables
