​​This short course was run by the very excellent James Marshall from Talking Ape. We had attended his presentation skills training last year which enabled me to do my TestBash Conference talk.

The training really rocks the foundation of thoughts on creativity.

'Creativity' is about thinking of new things. 'Innovation' is about getting those new ideas implemented. This makes me think of the Joel About Software rule for hiring "smart and gets things done". I realise that even if I have smart ideas, it is no use if I don't have the influence skills to get them built.​​​​

My takeaways are: 1. to schedule specific innovation time, 2. to improve my influence skills
