Had a good day at Crystal Palace athletics. Always a good meet because it's the athletes last chance to practice before the World Championships (in Korea).

Phillips Idowu set a good opening distance in the triple jump but was eclipsed by two others. Lisa Dobrisky won her race and other Brits managed A-rated times in order to help their late selection for the Worlds.
