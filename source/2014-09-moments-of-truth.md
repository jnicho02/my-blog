​​​​I've been watching videos about user journeys. A user journey maps all the interactions between the user and your product.

Part of this chat on user journeys discusses where the 'journey' actually begins. In our case, does the 'house buying journey' begin when a househunter makes an offer? or when their solicitor starts searches? or when they start looking at places they might want to live? Thinking about the whole buying process can make us consider more what underlying problems our reports solve.

Moments of Truth are points in the process where the user considers the value they are receiving from the product. For example, when you see the price of a train ticket you stop and think "really, that much!". These are the points where you have to _really_ work on the user's experience. I had to stop watching because the presenter kept saying "Moment of Truth" in almost every sentence.
