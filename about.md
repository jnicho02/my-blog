## About 

Hi, my name is Jez Nicholson but on the web I often have the handle jnicho02

I'm paid to play with the web. I think.

I am one of the developers of <a href="http://openplaques.org">openplaques.org</a> and the Head of Technology at <a href="http://argyllenviro.com">Argyll Environmental</a>, part of <a href="http://www.landmark.co.uk/">Landmark Information Group</a>. I am a keen attendee of unconferences and hack days.
