Just finished watching Matt Raible on TheServerSide.com talking about AppFuse and Spring. After I had big success in a project by introducing [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/) I became interested in web frameworks. Matt has the approach of stitching the frameworks together into a platform so that you could choose which one you want to implement. Basically, you end up with a flexible ant build.xml, some optional libraries and standard directories, which is exactly what I was moving towards when basing new projects on old ones. We've used AppFuse on a couple of projects now, to great success, and I would highly recommend it if you are into Java web applications without EJB.
