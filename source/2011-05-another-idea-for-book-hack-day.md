My next thought for Book Hack Day <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/book-hack-day/">http://lanyrd.com/2011/book-hack-day/</a> is a favourite of mine when I was a child, The Voyages Of Marco Polo. I've no idea how I got hold of it in the first place, I assume that it was from my parents, but I loved this book. The edition in Waterstones has some nice maps showing modern day names for locations. Maybe a geo-based web site could bring it to life?!
