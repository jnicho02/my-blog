​​​​I was watching BBC Children's TV the other day (I was channel hopping, honest!) and saw a program called 'Do Something Different'. It is probably the modern equivalent of 'Why Don't You..'. Anyhoo, the TV program is the front-end for http://www.bbc.co.uk/dsd/ It's a Web 2.0 sort of thing because the program presents ideas posted by kids to the web site and discusses which areas of the country have completed the most new things this week, etc. It's the first time that I have seen a web site that isn't a second thought but is an integral part of the TV program. The interface is quite jazzy (aka garish) too.
