​This might be a bit extreme to include as personal development, but the intention was to research User Experience by exploring how people think. I'm reading a number of books around the subject and trying to read an hour a day during the week.

My main interest in this book was the claim that many of the characteristics of a psychopath are actually highly values in the corporate world. For example, 'Chainsaw' Al Dunlap https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_J._Dunlap​ was a turnaround specialist and professional downsizer. Dunlap actually enjoyed firing people.

In all, the book was an interesting read but probably not on the required UX reading list!
