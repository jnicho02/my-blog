​​​Principally a book about advertising, this book is still extremely relevant to User Experience and User Centred Design thinking. It is also pretty inspiring to.

Unsurprisingly, as it is written by an ace advertiser, the format of the book is big bold statements in large type plus some more in-depth articles.

I read it through twice and will no doubt read it again until it all sinks in.
