​​​​So, today i've been watching Bruce Snyder on TheServerSide talking about Castor et al. I like the way the TSS have presented the movie on that web page by having a transcript of the conversation. Made me think about QuickTime For Java and whether you could use that to add subtitles to the movie....maybe you'd need a markup language like SMIL to set the timings?
