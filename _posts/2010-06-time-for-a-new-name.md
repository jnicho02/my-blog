So, i've been blogging here on-and-off since August 2005 as 'The Jezblog' and I got to thinking that maybe I should go for it a bit more professionally...like, get a url and a design and things like that. I'm not going to go on about plans, etc. as it's embarrassing when you don't end up having the time to do them.

Anyways, seeing as I ramble about games and technology the new name is "It's All In The Game" which is from a song by Tommy Edwards...
