I've just spotted the Book Hack Day <br /><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/book-hack-day/">http://lanyrd.com/2011/book-hack-day/</a> in London 14th May 2011 and have <br />spun a few ideas around my head. I would like to create a performance <br />of a book via Twitter conversations between characters. Another <br />possibility is a geo version of Ulysses by James Joyce <br /><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4300/pg4300.txt">http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4300/pg4300.txt</a> for <br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday</a> <p /> Anyway, I had better check my calendar before assembling a team
