​​Being lost is not a bad thing. It is about letting go, ceasing to worry about things, being immersed in what you are doing. This book discusses these ideas in a somewhat poetical way, much in the way that George Monbiot discussed rewilding in Feral. I would class it more of a personal book than a work book. However, the line I draw between those two spaces is very blurred.
