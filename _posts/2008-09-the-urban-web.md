dConstruct08: "The Urban Web" - Steven Johnson from outside.in
Just listened to a talk from Steven Johnson from outside.in talking about "The Urban Web" at dConstruct 2008, a web conference in Brighton, UK.

He started by talking about an infamous cholera outbreak in Broad Street, London in the 1800s originating from a water pump. This outbreak is famous because John Snow produced a map displaying the location and number of deaths, along with a line that showed where it was easier to go to the Broad Street pump than another pump. This data visualisation was referenced in Tufte's famous book on data visualisation.

outside.in have been working on a set of tools to identify posts/tweets/news about local geographical places and tag them with geo position. In this way, you could view the web as a local resource rather than a global one, for example by seeing all of the information posted about central Brighton.

I was interested in his vision of a local web for local people, something that we i've been musing about for game worlds as well as real-life worlds.

Mobile trends talk
I went to a talk about the latest trends in mobile gaming.

Great Animation
The latest trend is for big bold characters, large enough to be bold rather than shrunk to fit lots onto the screen.

Cheeky touches.

Different Palettes
The limitations of mobile have in effect freed designers from the console's shades-of-grey reality. Stark monochrome with flashes of colour can be effective in displaying characters.

Stick Figures
Similarly, characters do not need to be realistically rendered. Stick figures made out of circles can be good. E.g. Xiao Xiao

Star Ratings
A 5-star rating for a level taking account of speed, accuracy, etc. can make for a replayable game. Levels can be easy to complete, so as not to put off casual gamers, but hard to master. There needs to be a reward for achieving 5 stars.

Unlockable Modes
Retro Chop Em Ups
e.g. Tetris Pop

e.g. Namco Arcade Golf: after finishing a hole, the player can play pacman for 30 seconds to earn a reward.

Cool Physics
e.g. Sola Rola, Gish, Enigmo.

Sandboxes
freeplay with no game target

Genre Mashups
Including a traditional game (like a card game) as part of the game mechanic. People will already know how to play and remember the 'brand' e.g. Puzzle Quest, Creatures of the Deep.

Contextual Controls
Using a single button that changes purpose depending on the current situation. e.g. Pro Evolution Soccer mobile.

Pigs
Well, 'fun' anyway. e.g. Piglympics. You know what you're getting just by the name: pigs, doing olympic sports.

Asynchronous Multiplayer
Turn-based spread out over time. E.g. Spore Origins, Anytime Pool for FaceBook.

Simple Buttons, Complex Movements
A single button to control what happens, but has to be pressed at just the right time. e.g. Kimikaze Robots.

Motion Puzzlers
Using the tilt detection powers of the device e.g. stuff on the iPhone

Touchscreen Only Controls
e.g. The iPhone. Lots of lessons can be learn from the DS Lite

Whack-a-mole Control
The screen real estate is divided into 9 and the keypad buttons correspond to that sector to control where you fire a gun at say. With a bit of thought, this can be made interesting.

Level Editors
Create and share. Remember the 'YouTube rule' that 2% of people are creators and 98% of people are consumers. E.g. Boom Blox

Pre-rendered 3D
Playing the game on top of a photorealistic background. e.g. Table Tennis Star. This can look great and really stand out from the crowd as long as the gameplay is good.

Friend Rankings
The league table should be of people that you know, not the whole world.

Achievements/Feats
Skins/Avatars/Unlockables

Seeding code to catch pirates
One thing that was mentioned in a talk at the Develop Conference was the idea of seeding your code with redundant blocks. That way, you would be able to prove if someone had copied you outright or even reverse engineered. This is a common technique in mapping (the Ordnance Survey include secret, non-existent features into their maps) and in the Yellow Pages.

Lessons learnt from i-gaming sites
Internet gambling games are aimed at people who have lots of money to spend + focus heavily on getting the money from people as quickly and easily as possible. The games industry could learn a lot from them, and they better had before they start losing customers to them.

That was the main message of a talk by Phil Mochan of Media and Game Technologies http://www.mediagametech.com/ at Develop 2008 yesterday. It's unglamourous when compared to the other talks, but Phil is pretty much on the button.

Targetting
i-gaming is short for internet gaming and sort of means "games for money", not necessarily gambling per se. It originates from online casinos. The online monthly spend of a US i-gamer is around $72 compared to $12 for a gamer. Does that mean that people who produce games are selling to the wrong people? or do different types of people want different products? The online gaming industry should be working ahrder to identify who has the money and make games for them rather than making games for themselves and then trying to sell them to people who haven't got that much spare cash anyway.

Covergence of gaming and i-gaming
The fact that the i-gaming industry is moving towards making the i-games more gamelike and less the traditional gambling as they try to diversify might indicate that deep down people want the same thing - a bit of fun and a sense of achievement.

Integrate Billing Early
Billing is an integral part of a paid-for game, after all if you can't charge people to play then you won't get any revenue. However, the online games industry seem to leave it to the last minute to think about it. All of our effort is focussed on making a great, fun, challenging gaming experience that gamers want to keep coming back to. Which is a fine endeavour, but it needs to be treated as a commercial enterprise too which is probably where the difficulty lies. Game developers are artists, not business people. Commercial success is gained through making an addictive game, not by clever targetting and we certainly don't make it easy for people to sign up, start playing or pay us.

A word of warning
The i-gamers are eyeing up the gaming market and thinking that they can take a slice of it. They've been through the struggle of coping with regulations and of making it easy for people to give them money, so they may well be able to implement their gambling-related games much more smoothly than the games industry. The casual games market will be the first battlefield.

The Wall of Common Sense
As a reminder to everyone, stick cards on the wall with common sense and common design flaws.

This is an idea that I got from a highly entertaining talk by Paul Barnett of EA Mythic. One of the things that he said was that he was fed up of giving people the same reasons why an idea wasn't sensible that he just wanted to be able to point to it on the wall. This sounded very like a SCRUM tool to me, and if it isn't then it should be. I will be implementing it asap and spreading the word for it to be adopted.

Common Sense Example: "Users will never read the manual"

Design Flaw Example: "A concept that's complicated to describe won't be fun when implemented" ( Jul 31 2008, 09:35:53 AM BST ) Permalink Comments [0]

Bioshock keynote
I just watched a keynote speech by the developers of the game Biochock at Develop 2008 Conference. Here are some of the things that I found interesting:

Mise en Scene
It's hard not to find that title pretentious, but it their best way of describing how the world of Bioshock was created. Everything in the game happened for a reason, so if there is a corpse in a room then they thought about how that person died, what they were doing and what would have happened to the objects they had. E.g. if they were reading a magazine and drinking a soda then the magazine will be on the floor with the spilt drink.

The difficulty is in telling a story without using cut scenes or voiceovers (which always seemed to me a sign of failure) by building characters from evidentual artifacts or by being part of scenes that explain what is going on. In fact, if there is a strong underlying story then this is the game.

Time
They had the luxury of time and money. This meant that the production schedule was different, they were allowed to make mistakes and change direction.

Their opinion of a AAA game is that you'll be incredibly scared on the release day. You should never be 100% satisfied with any of it and b constantly revisiting and refining.

Why it is underwater
They new that it would be set in an underwater complex very early on in the design because you need to 'trap' the player in a constrained environment to give a claustrophoic horror atmosphere.

Team Structure
The writer was very integrated into the process. It was not a case of writing a script, bunging it to the developers and letting them build it. There were daily sessions discussing current functionality and thinking of changes and riffing off of it. The team sat together in an open plan area, separated by project and not by function.

PlayStation Network Home
I'm currently at the Develop Conference 2008 in Brighton, UK. It's a games developer conference and I am interested in seeing where the web world and the games world are colliding/merging

The guys from Sony showed us PSN Home. Much of this was old news having seen the beta, but the occasional bit was interesting. Here are some of my thoughts.

Real looking
The whole thing looks very real life to me. A bit like The Sims. I hope that there are no limitations on what could be created as personally I don't want to create an online apartment that looks like a Ikea catalogue. It feels very consumerist to me, but maybe that is what users want. They say that furniture can be "anything that will fit into an apartment" which sounds promising. The avatars are human shaped and can be clothed or styled with custom (developer produced) content such as hairstyles.

Rewards
PSN Home Rewards are linked to a Home Object. Following a Lua scripted event a player can be given a ticket. This ticket is then exchangable for a Home Object such as a t-shirt or could be used to unlock hidden areas or entire Scenes.

Standard 2D PlayStation rewards can be displayed on a player's apartment wall. 3D rewards will be implemented specially for Home later.

Launching
Starting games with people that you have met is one of the USPs. Home doesn't attempt to take functionality away from the game but instead communicates with it. A Game Launch Object is created within Home which can be scripted using Lua. It creates an XML file describing the people who want to be in the group game. This is then passed to the game, the PS3 resets and the normal multiplayer launch follows. It made me wonder whether the same XML could be created from a web layer viewed on the PS3.

Real Estate
There are common areas such as shopping malls, so I asked a slightly mischievious question about what would happen when the shops started to get full, would we then be paying rental for real estate. The answer was more about the consumer experience than the Game Publishers so I remain wary that Sony will be charging the equivelant of leaseholds a la Second Life.

They also talked about instancing and the "as any of your friends as possible will be in your instance" so maybe there are problems to be solved there.

Media
Home can display similar media as the PS3/PSP, i.e. jpg, png, mp4. The metaphor used is that of TV screens attached to the wall of the apartment which didn't seem very innovative to me. I think that i'd prefer to have a 2D screen that can apear in the middle of the air on command, but maybe this is possible but not implemented yet.

Desktop icons are just meaningless to me
I've given up using desktop icons. Well, not exactly, i've given up using the desktop icons that are provided with the various applications and am now abitrarily allocating a horror themed icon to each on my desktop. Sorry to the graphic designers who made the icons for various apps, but it appears that I don't use them for recognising the application at all. I have proved that it is the word beneath the icon that matters to me and not the content of the image. I'm not going to push the experiment as far as making all desktop icons the same, but I am far happier with the aesthetics of my desktop now.

team workspace vs getting too comfy
My team moved from one of our office buildings to the other last week. The move was forced on us, so didn't go down too well with the team, but sometimes these things have to happen as there is limited space. I would have preferred to stay physically close to game developers as I believe that the social web will be harder to integrate with what they do than with Marketing who are generally happy to accept that anything that gives the product more exposure is good. The next big challenge for Marketing is how to measure and analyse the effectiveness of social web features, game devs will probably be involved with the nuts and bolts of implementation.

I am feeling a sudden return of the desire to blog because I am currently stuck on my sofa with a sprained ankle. The peace and quiet is glorious and i've been able to think for the first time since moving offices. I guess that i'll start to work at home a bit more. My ultimate plan is that when I get a bigger house so that my whole team can move out of the office for a day a week.

It's important to have a team workspace, a sense of home. The move was good in one way because it triggered a redesign. I felt re-energised by a change of environment (immediately counteracted by the new distraction levels) and now I am interested in how often a team should change desks. I get the feeling that you can get too comfy staying in one place for too long. But how long is too long? Maybe we should all switch desks at a regular interval?

The enforced peace and quiet of home has also let my catch up on my reading. I've finished "FastSOA: The way to use native XML technology to achieve Service Oriente Architecture governance, scalability and performance" by Frank Cohen and am now reading "The Black Swan" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb which was a free gift from Penguin (thank you Penguin!) at last Saturday's Interesting2008

Interesting2008


I went to Interesting2008 on Saturday and it lived up to it's name. I saw Russell Davies speak at dconstruct2007 and think that he is a inciteful thinker, so when I saw that he runs a mini-conference every year to which he invites 'interesting' people to speak for 5, 10 or 20 minutes I jumped at it.

I'm going to list a few of the highlights for me, but really it was a "you had to be there" thing:

Lego is Full of Win
Roo Reynolds spoke about his love for Lego (which is only referred to as 'Legos' in the US before anyone comments). I liked the way that his slides were on a slideshow and that he wasn't triggering them. This kept it quick and punchy. The slides themselves were pictures, so there wasn't a need to process them too much. Enthusiasm about the subject helps too.

This presentation by itself has inspired me to run some sort of Interesting at work.

Horses can't see in front of their noses and have a fight-or-flight instinct
Gemma told us about why horses think that rustling crisp packets are lions or bears dues to the blind spots behind them and in front of their noses, plus the fight-or-flight instinct. This immediately made me think of peripheral vision for characters in Zombie Attack (the game that my team are writing as a Gold Day activity. I see another post there)

This connected as well with an article in the Saturday Times magazine about how to survive disasters. We should really speak of fight-flight-or-freeze instinct as a captured animal may play dead to put an attacker off (some attackers are wary of already dead prey as it might be diseased or off).

Winston Churchill was interesting
I was surprised by the subject matter and liked the presentation.

Azaroth is very small and incredibly dense
This speaker (James Wallis) carried out a geographical survey of World of Warcraft. By knowing how fast a character can walk and having a straight line to navigate he was able to put a scale to the map of Azaroth. This put it at roughly the size of the Newcastle (JN: changed after a comment from James on my Flickr picture) and about 10% the size of the Death Star (generally reckoned to have a diameter of 120kms).

 


Further experiments with jumping from comparing the known height of a character to a tall building and then jumping from said building and timing how long it takes to hit the ground showed that gravity is 1G, the same as Earth. This means that the planet(oid) must be extremely dense at 5850g/cm3 (Earth is 5.5 g/cm3) which may explain why dropped items are hard to pick up again as they may be covered in very heavy dust.



There was a final anomoly though. It seems that the planetoid may be flat as you can get to the edge.



The new coin design will be like a jigsaw puzzle


Matt Dent won a Royal Mint competition to design the reverse of British coins. Each will have part of the design of a heraldic shield on.

Users go through steps of social web


George Oats from Flickr talked about:

anonymity
recognition of you
community
leadership
celebrity (fame)
Many users like to get awards/badges on Flickr. These have value as they are public recognition. I wonder whether there is a difference in value because they are awarded by other users rather than being official.

Scribbles can be good art
I liked this analysis of a form of naive art, scribbles.



random scribbles (- note paper = informality)
drawing less well than the can
studied clumsiness
handlettered copy (vital addition)
capturing essential features with few, shaky lines
This rang true for me as I was earlier inspired by rememble.com to draw some cartoons of my recollections. I found it a lot easier than just writing about them.

Is writing a computer game like writing modern fiction?
In the case of a text adventure, it looks quite like fiction seeing as it is words. A graphical game has less surface appearance, but I still hear terms such as 'narrative' and 'backstory' being used by game designers (I sit next to them in the office) so it seems that they are related. Therefore, I decided to read a book about how to start a modern fiction story to see if it is relevant. The book was 'Hooked - write fiction that grabs the readers at page one and never lets them go'.

The key lessons I learnt are:

You must get your readers (players) attention at the beginning otherwise they will not continue. In the case of a book they might well be picking it up in a bookshop to see if they want to buy. For a game, i'm not sure....maybe it's a teaser video on the web?
The story should start with the protagonist being involved in action as soon as possible. This should be an 'inciting incident' that introduces the 'initial surface problem'
The initial surface problem should lead on to another problem, then another, then another. This all adds up to 'Trouble' with a capital T...
...until the protagonist works out that there is an underlying 'story worthy problem' that is actually cause of all this trouble.
Before you can plunge the protagonist into trouble there needs to be some 'setup' to lead them into the action. This should be as little as possible. It could even be as short as a couple of sentences.
Give the reader the 'backstory' after the inciting incident to fill them in a bit more about the protagonist.
In conclusion, I would say that game developers must be quite a bit like modern fiction authors. They are performing a similar task using different mediums.

Test Driven Text adventure development
To continue my investigations into text adventure programming using Inform7 I have been thinking about different types of puzzles. I was browsing through a Game Design book in Borders which included a short paragraph on puzzle types. If I remember rightly, the list is as below:

ordinary use of an object: use something for it's normal purpose
extraordinary use of an object: use something in a way that it wasn't originally intended
in-the-middle: erm...i'll fill this in later when I remember what it is!
chain of events: A causes B, elsewhere in the game C causes D, player summises that B will cause C so that A --> D
timing: performing an action before or after a specific event
preparing the way: do something so that when another event occurs then it has a different result
fabrication: make something out of a number of objects
dialogue: by leading the conversation down a particular path, the solution is reached
people: by understanding character's unique personalities the player can use them to achieve a desired action
cryptogram / word: an anagram, hidden word, play on meaning (like a crossword clue)
riddle: a classic riddle puzzle
classic: a puzzle historically used in text adventures
I would like to write an example of each type of puzzle in Inform in order to learn how it works

Ordinary use of an object: Opening a bottle of wine
My first attempt is to code opening a bottle of wine.
Iteration 1: Give it a title and write a test
"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "open bottle" holding the wine.
This will fail to compile as Inform doesn't know what the wine is. This is fixed by introducing a room with a bottle of wine in:

"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "open bottle" holding the wine.
The lounge is a room.
The bottle of wine is in the lounge.
This will now compile, but the test will result in nothing happening

lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (empty) here.

>test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)

>[1] open bottle
That's not something you can open.
Iteration 2: Make the bottle into something that is openable
"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "open bottle" holding the wine.
The lounge is a room.
The bottle of wine is in the lounge. The bottle of wine is an openable container.
results in:

lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (empty) here.

>test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)

>[1] open bottle
That's already open.
The bottle appears to be already open.

Iteration 3: The bottle should be closed
"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "open bottle" holding the wine.
The lounge is a room.
The bottle of wine is a closed openable container in the lounge.
results in:

lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (closed) here.

>test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)

>[1] open bottle
You open the bottle of wine.
But, it shouldn't be that easy, you should use a corkscrew

Iteration 4: Lock the bottle
The bottle of wine is a closed openable locked container in the lounge.
Gives:

lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (closed) here.

>test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)

>[1] open bottle
It seems to be locked
.
Iteration 5: Introduce a corkscrew
The corkscrew is in the lounge.
Iteration 6: Use the corkscrew to open the bottle
"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "take corkscrew / unlock bottle with the corkscrew / open bottle" holding the wine.
The lounge is a room.
The bottle of wine is a closed openable locked container in the lounge.
The corkscrew is in the lounge.
The corkscrew unlocks the wine bottle.
results in:

lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (closed) and a corkscrew here.

>test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)

>[1] take corkscrew
Taken.

>[2] unlock bottle with the corkscrew
You unlock the bottle of wine.

>[3] open bottle
You open the bottle of wine.
Iteration 7: Make the English more natural
rather than unlocking the bottle, then opening it, it is more natural to just 'open the bottle with the corkscrew'

Test wine with "take corkscrew / open bottle with the corkscrew" holding the wine. ( Jan 08 2008, 09:08:17 AM GMT ) Permalink Comments [0]

Targets of an Agile Manager
Joh and I held the fort for the Brighton Agile Forum last night by discussing a number of Agile issues over beers at The Eagle. One thing we discussed was what the ultimate targets of an Agile Manager are. Targets being the slightly abstract concepts that lead you to achieve the end goals.

An Autonomous Process aka Make Yourself Redundant
Joh suggested that it was to create a process that will work without you, i.e. to make yourself redundant. Easy enough to test: when you go on holiday does everything crumble? or do you have to put in double hours the week before making sure that everything is all set up?

This reminded me of being a DBA or a Linux Admin. A test of whether you are doing it right is that people start to believe that you don't do anything, as you have set up the systems so smoothly that they either never go wrong, or if they do then it is easily corrected.

Our current process is simple but effective.

A requirement is identified and agreed with the business
Short sprints each have a defined high level user story which is meaningful to the end customer
The sprint story is a collection of smaller user stories (preferably agreed with the business)
Each story is listed in a bug tracker under the release indicated as the 'next iteration'
Developers can choose any story from the 'next iteration' to work on
A Developer may only have one story/issue assigned to them at any one time
Every issue must have tests written to prove that it works
Tests should be written before any code
A continuous integration server, which is set up the same as the live server, integrates code and tests
Every project contains (nearly) everything that you need to build and run (I say 'nearly' as we don't currently include Apache and PHP)
Developers can set up their development environments however they like
See The Big Picture
I started thinking about what it is that I do that isn't part of our current devlopment process. At the moment I believe that we have implemented a process that is quite efficient but doesn't see 'The Big Picture'. I think that the role that I provide is that of an Analyst. I sit between the development process and the business and decide what we should develop in order to enhance their work. This is a creative activity that involves experience and imagination. Once it has been decided 'what' we want to achieve, then the development process kicks in and actually produces it. However, the isn't all decided up front (as a BDUF - Big Design Up Front) but may appear as the development continues. So, how do we adjust the development process to lead the developers towards insightful decisions about the direction of the project as a whole?

Agile text adventure development
Inform is a tool for writing text adventures. It is a domain specific language presented via a slick editor interface (since version 7) and works somewhat like a book: you write about the scenery; create characters; define actions and reactions; create puzzles. The reader (player) then takes the role of the lead character.

I've used it before with the Brighton Coding Dojo Festival night and at the Brighton Farm Hack Day, but both times we reached the limit of what we could achieve without reading the manual. So, seeing as i've had to use up all my remaining holidays and am off for Christmas already, I thought that i'd give it a spin. First thing was to check that I am following my much-touted Agile processes!

Simplest thing first
This is fairly easy with Inform. The most basic thing that you can do is give your adventure a name, declare a room and then run the program. The language is compiled, but the editor will do that for you. 
"The Flat" by Jez Nicholson 
The lounge is a room.

test driven development
I lose points for not noticing that Inform has some built in testing functionality. It lets you define named tests as a set of commands that the user would enter. 
Test mytestname with "go north" 
To run the test, run the game and type test mytestname. There doesn't appear to be any way to react to the result of this test, so it must be run manually and visually inspected. I suppose that a final condition could be checked for, e.g. whether the user has a specific object in their possession. It is also possible to call individual tests from another one so a 'test all'. 
test all with "test mytestname / test mytestname2 / etc."

I have now begun doing TDD by writing the tests first. 
e.g. Test Jane with "ask jane about dinner / ask jane about wine" references a person called Jane and will cause a compile error until the character has been created: Jane is a person.

The tests in Inform7 also allow you to specify some starting conditions, e.g.
Test wine with "drop wine / give wine to Jane" in the lounge holding the wine. 
This test specifies that it will occur in the lounge (where Jane is) and whilst you are holding the wine (which it will retrieve from wherever it is).

Continuous integration
The project could be checked into Subversion and have Cruise Control or something working, but i'm not sure how automated build and testing would run. The language does compile up to a runtime that can be played on a number of open sourced engines, so it is possible that a test client could be written that interacts with it. I would need to see if the compiler can be called from the command line.

Long-term goal
Something I learnt from the Hack Day is that the target for the text adventure is not just that the puzzles should work, but that there should be an interesting narrative. This was highlighted by Thom's Dad joining our team and focussing on working from the desired end result backwards, an approach that is part of Edward De Bono's Lateral Thinking course. This makes me think that I must look at my Agile/SCRUM/etc. and see how the eventual long-term goal is voiced.

Corridor testing
The good thing about writing a game is that 'normal' people (i.e. wives, girlfriends, parents) can be easily encouraged to have a go at the work-in-progress.

Short iterations
Having corridor testers encourages this, as you need to have a working version at all times. It is really frustrating to have someone show interest, but you have to tell that it was working 5 minutes ago and will take you about 5 to fix it..then another 5..then another..They will soon wander off and do something else!

Writing tests first also encourages short iterations as the language is compiled. You won't want to have loads of tests that break the build for too long.

Widgety Goodness 2007UK
Went to a conference on widgets last week. Here are some of the memes that I picked up.

Chris Cunningham, Freewebs
Users have a voracious appetite for things to publish on their personal sites.
If someone embeds a widget on their page then this serves to identify who they are to the widget and it can customise content. (Me...to myself)
Value in the near-term is in honing your skills, but in the long term is through 'Engagement Marketing'.
To be 'successful' widget must have a personal outcome and a purpose
Russell Davies, Open Intelligence Agency
"the more you know about me, the more it freaks me out". CRM can reach an uncanny valley point and scare the user.
If you get something wrong when you personalise it, then it is really bad. Why personalise things that you don't have to? e.g. getting your name wrong on the hotel room's TV screen welcome message.
"give me meaning, give me fun"
Simon Andrews
Viral doesn't work if you are just using as a cheap option. Traditional advertising methods will be needed to publicise the widgets.
Traditional marketing agencies don't know what to do with them as it is low(er) spend + they are geared up to produce TV, print and/or large web sites.
"It's time to experiment"
Colm O'Connor, Joost
Widgets are connected to 'the future of TV'....but I can't say what it is yet.
There's something extremely interesting about Joost, but I can't put my finger on it. (me...to myself)
Emmanuel Prat, Widgetavenue
If you want to publish to multiple social networks then you probably need to use a Widget Distribution Platform.
It's a Write-One-Read-Anywhere problem. WidgetAvenue wrappers your widget so that it works anywhere.
don't do slides with green writing on white background. Especially when it is the most important line on the slide! (me...to myself)
Matthew Trewhella, Google
OpenSocial, is it a Widget Distribution Platform killer...or an enhancer? (me..to myself)
Ankur Shah, Techlightenment
The Dylan widget worked fantastically. Required zero advertising after being seeded to close (influentual?) friends first.
Interesting that the growth rate was not exponential. leads me to think that it had a viral index of 1 (on average, every recipient sent it on to one person)
Alex Bard, yourminis
Widgets can be classed as 'expression widgets' or 'consumption widgets'
'Expression widgets' just say something about the user. They are the 'new car sticker'. They tend to have a shorter lifespan as they don't generally involve any interaction.
'Consumption widgets' have a purpose, such as a weather feed, and may have a longer lifespan.
'Virality' is the index of how many people pass it on. To be called 'highly viral' your widget wants to have an index of 2-3 (i.e. on average every recipient passes it on to 2-3 friends).
Ori Soen Musestorm
Widget usage should be measured in detail. If it's a video then: how many people pressed play; how many people paused the video; how many people quit; etc.
A widget can be thought of a bit like a microsite
Once the widget is on a users site you can (and most definitely should) update it with new content.
Monitor engagement carefully, learn and optimise.
The design of the UI matters a lot, it should lead users to engage (me...to myself)
A Flash widget is still just a banner.
Musestorm doesn't wrapper widgets, it generates native apps for each platform.
Khris Loux, js-kit
SEO: how does you widget interact with indexing engines?
lots of other interesting stuff that went over my head (me..to myself)
Steve Touhill, Clearspring
Types of widgets usages lead to different window sizes: social net (400*300), start page (300*250), blog (skyscraper banner), ad (banner)
You can't pop out of MySpace
Seed widgets on fan sites
Track generational leads (people who got it from someone else) as well as people who got it from the source
Use other channels to plug your widget
Keep content fresh or your widget will be removed. It takes up real estate.
