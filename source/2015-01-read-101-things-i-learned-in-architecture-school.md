​​​This is a simple book, yet complex. I read it with the thought that architecting an IT system may have things to learn from architecting a building. When it comes to buildings, we often think of aesthetics. Less often in IT systems. Maybe we should? They both need to be accepted and used by humans. I know from experience that using a beautiful programming language or system can be a pleasure, and yet we only consider function when designing.
