The London SE1 Community Website News Map shows that geotagging is starting to take off. It's not new to add geourl and/or geotag information to a web page but I'm guessing that they must have added a feature to their content management system to encourage the geocoding of all news stories.

The release of Google Maps makes geotagging immediately more useful, as you can present the data in a good-looking interface. This may not be limited to the realm of web developers, as it's fairly easy to embed a web browser in a Java app, but I haven't experimented yet in order to get the javascript to work.
