I have a new mini obsession with photographing postboxes. there is a point to this. It's related to the Freedom Of Information request at <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/location_of_every_postbox_that">www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/location_of_every_postbox_that</a>, the Dracos site for identifying locations, and openstreetmap. These photos are from my iPhone with GPS turned on, so it should be possible to match them up with nodes on OSM.
