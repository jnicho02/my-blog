​​​​After attending the launch event the day before, I went up to London to the GeoVation problem workshop.

The 'Housing Challenge' intends to fund sustainable business ideas that focus of the 'housing crisis'. This was a workshop to specifically talk about problems and not solutions, and there are many when it comes to housing. Personally, I think that Landmark needs to be deeply knowledgeable about all aspects of the housing market, especially those that show pain points. After all, our products are ultimately there to solve these pains.
