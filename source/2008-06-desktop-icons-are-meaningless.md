I've given up using desktop icons. Well, not exactly, i've given up using the desktop icons that are provided with the various applications and am now abitrarily allocating a horror themed icon to each on my desktop. Sorry to the graphic designers who made the icons for various apps, but it appears that I don't use them for recognising the application at all. I have proved that it is the word beneath the icon that matters to me and not the content of the image. I'm not going to push the experiment as far as making all desktop icons the same, but I am far happier with the aesthetics of my desktop now.
