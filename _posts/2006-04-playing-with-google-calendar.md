So, i've been having a good play with Google Calendar. Frankly i'm amazed that there hasn't been a mainstream calendaring system around for years. It doesn't seem to be rocket science that you should be able to produce and consume streams of data in ical format, but maybe there was more to it than that!

Anyway, Google Calendar is a good example of a web 2.0 app using ajax and being developed in an Agile manner.

I've produced one public feed: England World Cup Glory (I think that you can see where i'm coming from...) with the dates of the soccer World Cup starting in June and some predictions of who is going to win various games.

If you've got Calendar then you can subscribe by: manage calendars....under 'other calendars' --> add calendar....public calendar tab....and paste in http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/bqnoop4s611jmcjcio5rvg92co@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic this  ical feed works in netvibes too as they have amended how their software processes ical feeds.

The rss feed is http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/bqnoop4s611jmcjcio5rvg92co@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic it seems to work in Sage/Firefox but not in other readers. I don't like the fact that it is in date changed ordered rather than in event date order but hey, maybe that's what an RSS feed should show? Plus I can't see how to change the event statuses yet.
