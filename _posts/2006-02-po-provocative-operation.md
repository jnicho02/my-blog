Sometimes good ideas come about by being deliberately provocative, not by trying to solve the problem directly. Thinking is a skill that we should all work on as one of the arsenal of technical skills needed in IT.

I've been reading Edward De Bono's Thinking Course. He introduces a term 'po' which could stand for 'provocative operation' or be part of hypothesis, suppose, possible or poetry. By stating a seemingly absurd standpoint, you might produce the unusual solution that cracks the problem.

* A reversal
* Exaggeration
* Distortion
* Wishful thinking
It made me think particularly about the web...How about taking a reasonable statement about how data is stored: "Data is stored in a central store called a database. It is held in a structured format and indexed for speed. Data is normalised so that a piece of information is unique and 'correct'." and completely reversing it: "Data is distributed widely as single nodes of information. It is held in an unstructured format and only the local index knows where it is. A piece of information may appear in numerous places having the same or different meaning depending upon the opinion of the author.". et viola, you've just described the internet.

People at FreeServe applied this to pricing of dial-up web access in the UK. Everyone was charging Â£25/month and then they came in and gave it away for free.

How about?

* Every citizen should be given their own, free, web site...
* Petrol should be given away free of charge....
* Parents should go to school with their kids...
* Kids should teach at school...
* The day should be divided in 20 hours...
