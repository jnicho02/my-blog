​Having read Kleon's first book "Steal Like An Artist" I thought i'd give this one a go.

The main premise is that by openly sharing multiple aspects of your process that you will be noticed and valued. It is also the only way to ever find other people in your 'tribe'. It doesn't mean that the end work itself is devalued, in fact it adds to the value.

On the way there is lots of encouragement to get out there. His shortlist of advice is:

* You don't have to be a genius
* Think process, not product
* Share something small every day
* Open up your cabinet of curiosities
* Tell good stories
* Teach what you know
* Don't turn into human spam
* Learn to take a punch
* Sell out
* Stick around​
