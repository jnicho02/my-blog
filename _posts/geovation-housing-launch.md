​​​​On Monday night I attended the launch of the GeoVation Housing Challenge​ by​ Ordnance Survey and the Land Registry. It was in The Building Centre, Store Street, London. Right outside was a WikiHouse to poke around in (i'll write a seperate post)

GeoVation is a programme from the Ordnance Survey to promote innovation in geographical-based systems. They help people/companies/groups to develop sustainable businesses from the idea stage to launch. This includes a bootcamp and the eventual 3-4 winners getting cash grants of around £30k. It is all a bit like X-Factor really.

The original problem setting stage of the process was in July and was attended by Colin Blears and Andy Noble.
