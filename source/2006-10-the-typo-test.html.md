I'm sure tat this makes me a pedant, but whenever I see any mistake on a website (e.g. a spelling mistake) then I email the site to tell them. I have zero tolerance to errors, and a typo makes people worry that you might have made errors in the lovely piece of software/tutorial/site that you are trying to sell. Saying this, I expect that this blog is full of typos...

How the site responds to the bug report also shows you what sort of service you might expect from them if you took them on as a supplier. So, full marks to Kevin Yank at An Introduction to AJAX overnight.
