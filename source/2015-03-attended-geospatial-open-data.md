​​​​This evening event was held at [Google Campus London](https://www.campus.co/london/en). The talks weren't quite up-to-scratch, but there were some interesting bits. I particularly liked [Robin Hawkes](http://rawkes.com/) talk about [Vizicities](http://vizicities.com/) which presents a 3D view of OpenStreetMap.
