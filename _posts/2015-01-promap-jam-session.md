​​​​This was a session seeking to distill and document some of the knowledge in-and-around Promap. It was a semi-training session to practice creating user personas and work out their real value.

My conclusion is that customer/user personas are hugely useful and we as an organisation urgently need these to be created and shared asap. The ownership probably lies with Product Management with a lot of assistance from Business Analysts.
