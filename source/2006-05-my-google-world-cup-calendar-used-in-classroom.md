I was very pleased to receive an email from murky telling me that my England World Cup Glory Google Calendar

"I teach IT, and today I've been showing the boys calendaring software - yours was used as an example, so you probably have quite a few subscribers!"

I had been playing with Google Calendar and used it as an example. A sign of duplicated effort on the net is that when I set the calendar up there weren't any others available, now there are 181.

If you have Google Calendar and wish to subscribe then:

* Under the Calendars list click 'manage calendars'
* Under Other Calendars click 'add calendar'
* Select Public Calendar Address
* Enter http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/bqnoop4s611jmcjcio5rvg92co@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic as the public address
You can add any ical calendar to Google Calendars. I have ones from upcoming.org on mine.

There is an RSS feed which is in 'last edited' order. Not sure how useful that is (?)
