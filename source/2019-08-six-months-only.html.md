Somebody once told me, "when you work for yourself, people are only interested in what you've done in the last 6 months" and I think that they were right.
This added to Maria Kondo equals my latest approach, which is that posts older than 6 months are deleted.
I could rewrite them if I really want to keep them. We will see.
