I just finished reading The 4 Disciplines of Execution, a book all about setting and achieving goals outside of 'the whirlwind'.

Good term that, 'the whirlwind', meaning the seeming neverending whirl of daily activities. How do you find time to do something over-and-above simply processing daily tasks and actually do something that moves forward?

The authors suggest:

# Discipline 1: Focus on the wildly important

- pick the single most important thing your group should achieve

- say how you know you've crossed the finishing line

# Discipline 2: Act on the Lead Measures

- think about cause-and-effect. The end goal is measured after the event, they call this a 'lag' measure. Try to identify simple day-to-day measurable things that you think have the ability to affect the end goal.

# Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

- display the 'score' on the wall so that everyone can see whether we are winning

# Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability

- meet every week for individuals to state what they have done last week and will do this week to move the lead measure.

This fits in very well with Agile where we are used to measuring and acting on it, e.g. Discipline 2 reminds me of burndown charts and finishing sprints -> better planning, less stress, better flow. Discipline 3 of Kanban charts on walls. Discipline 4 of daily standups.

I have found that Agile can get hyper focussed on delivering product efficiently (which isn't a bad thing!). 4 Disciplines adds strategy to Agile.
