This talk from Matthew Franglen of Brandwatch will cover PostgreSQL [Foreign Data Wrappers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers) which are tables that can read and write to external services. Efficient ways to run queries from 
applications will also be covered.

I am interested because Postgres has data wrappers for CouchDB, neo4j, as well as GDAL/OGR, GeoJson, and OpenStreetMap PBF
