​I'm quite excited that I have been accepted to speak at the Open Data Institute (the 'ODI') in October. I will be speaking about our first experiences of using open data in Landmark reports for the Energy & Infrastructure report. This report began life as the 'High Speed 2 report' after Tony Turck convinced HS2 Ltd to release their data. 

The sudden reduction in licence restrictions could drastically change the way we work. Normally, it can take a number of months to negotiate and organise licences giving us a time buffer to work in. Open data is available immediately. If it is important to be first to market then we had better get a move on.​ Groundsure are set up to react quickly. They don't need to be original and their product isn't the best quality, but they keep beating us to the jump. We have to speed up, or ensure that being first isn't the winning tactic.
