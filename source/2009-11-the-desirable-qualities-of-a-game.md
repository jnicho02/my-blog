I've been reading "Man, Play and Games" by Roger Caillois and saw this list of the qualities of a game:

* The need to prove one's superiority
* The desire to challenge, make a record, or merely overcome an obstacle
* The hope for and the pursuit of the favour of destiny
* Pleasure in secrecy, make-believe, or disguise
* Fear or inspiring of fear
* The search for repetition or symmetry, or in contrast, the joy of improvising, inventing, or infinitely varying solutions
* Solving a mystery or riddle
* The satisfaction procured from all arts involving contrivance
* The desire to test one's strength, skill, speed, endurance, equilibrium, or ingenuity
* Conformity to rules and laws, the duty to respect them, and the temptation to circumvent them
* And lastly, the intoxication, longing for ecstasy, and desire for voluptuous panic

Caillois splits games into three partitions (or combinations of them): Agon (competition); Alea (chance); Mimicry (simulation); Ilinx (vertigo).

What I find interesting is that these were written in 1958 and they are still applicable. I have found the book good so far for analysing what and why people play online.
