As a reminder to everyone, stick cards on the wall with common sense and common design flaws.

This is an idea that I got from a highly entertaining talk by Paul Barnett of EA Mythic. One of the things that he said was that he was fed up of giving people the same reasons why an idea wasn't sensible that he just wanted to be able to point to it on the wall. This sounded very like a SCRUM tool to me, and if it isn't then it should be. I will be implementing it asap and spreading the word for it to be adopted.

Common Sense Example: "Users will never read the manual"

Design Flaw Example: "A concept that's complicated to describe won't be fun when implemented"
