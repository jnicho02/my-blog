[http://mhms.org.uk/](http://mhms.org.uk/) are doing some interesting historical work by digitising the old Brighton Street Directories and the property registers. I took this photo in Kemp Street where a number of the houses are displaying lists of all the people who have owned the property since it's construction in the 1800's.
I particularly like the way that they have taken data and turned it into an artefact that can be used by people in the street, at the physical place where it happened. In [http://openplaques.org](http://openplaques.org) we do it the other way round, recording digitally the physical artefact that has been placed on a building. There is also a difference as mhms isn't just about famous people.
I offered to help a while ago, but got no reply. Maybe we can crossover when they feature somewhere with blue plaques, such as Regency Square.
