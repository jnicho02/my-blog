​​I've been working on an idea for how to track personal development and at the same time create some better interaction at work.

I write a blog post for each activity I have completed and date it for the day I did the thing. I then tag it with 'time-spent' meaning that I can really easily pull up a list​. I use this when i'm asked how many hours i've done, or for a Performance Development Review.
