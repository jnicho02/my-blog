Just added a geourl.org physical location meta tag to my blog's template. Gave me a few thoughts:

Do I really want people to know where I am? Is the positioning too exact to retain privacy?
I wonder whether Google are going to use this tag to assist with positioning pages on GoogleMaps?
I see also that someone is working on a geourl-neighbours-2-GoogleMaps xslt stylesheet.
There are also comments about geourl spam, i.e. sites registering themselves at a location when they've got nothing to do with it. There will have to be some way to confirm the location given.
