I've been planning to add some simple audio blogs to our company web site. In particular, short one-on-one interviews which will probably be held at the interviewees premises. My first thought was to use an electronic dictaphone or even use the iPhone Record app.

We tried out a dictaphone and the results were pretty good. The unit itself was pretty cheap £50-60 and it is very portable. The sound quality wasn't bad, but as with all audio you have to be careful of background noise.

Friends from the BNM list suggested a number of things:

"I'd recommend a decent microphone. I've got a Samson CO30 USB microphone and it seems really good. It's not massively expensive (~£100) and the USB interface means you can plug it into something like a laptop or even an iPad (via the camera connection kit). With a laptop you can record directly in something like Audacity (free) and use that to edit your recording."

"use an Edirol recorder- cheap, portable, stereo and portable. Excellent results too.!"

The other question was whether I should I host the files on our Wordpress site, or the audio equivalent of YouTube?

"Audioboo is pretty good for that sort of thing: http://audioboo.fm/ I'm sure there'll be plugins for wordpress to pull in the audio from there."

"AudioBoo might be a good option. I'm sure they'll host it for you for free depending on the length of recordings (up to 5 mins is free per recording).
Plus you can embed the individual players."

"Soundcloud might be worth a look for hosting the audio."

"Host it wherever seems best for your needs. If you're not going to get a huge number of downloads then your own servers will be fine. If you expect a large number of downloads then something like SoundCloud or some sort of Amazon CDN might be better."

"Check out http://mixlr.com You can broadcast live then save it directly to wherever you want. Works on PC / Mac / iPhone."

"The other benefit of using another service is SEO - it will increase your ranking with more links and keywords to your company site."
