The final day of WhereCamp was an iBeacon hack day. But, i'm not here to talk about that now, but instead talk about <a href="http://artefactshop.com/">Artefact cards</a>​.

The cards are business card sized and blank. It seems like a con, but it turns out that they are really useful for planning out concepts and explaining ideas.

We were working on an idea for a capture-the-flag-style game using iBeacons and I was able to demonstrate by drawing pictures on the cards. I could have used Post-Its, but somehow the slightly more solid​ feel of the cards make them more readily accepted.

As an aside, 'card UI' is now a major design metaphor being used for mobile and web design. Cards are used to contain information for a single object and it makes it easier to build a responsive design (one that will resize itself intelligently for different screen sizes).
