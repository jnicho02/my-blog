I am pleased to see that someone is campaigning against the introduction of on-street parking permits to the Preston Park area of Brighton.

This annoys me about our city. It is effectively a car tax because the Council are just charging people to park outside (near) their own house. The permits are brought in zone by zone by appealing to peoples' baser side, i.e. if you are next to an area with permits then 'they' will spill over and park in 'your' spaces.

The frontage of most houses in this area is slightly longer than a single car length. Many houses have two or more vehicles. They can't all fit. If you bring in permits then you still have the same problem. It is _not_ 'outsiders' that are taking your stuff, it is you.

There then follows a sorry fascimile of democracy. Pro-permit leaflets are distributed to houses and councillors talk to the local press about how residents have begged them for parking permits. Then there is a poorly advertised 'vote' where households can respond. A tiny proportion of residents respond and more of them say yes than no. This is then stated as "the majority of householders in the area believe in permits" which it patently is not.

As it happens, I don't own a car. I might want to get one in the future, and I don't want to have to pay to park near my own house.
