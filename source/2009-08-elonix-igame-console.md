The Sunday Times carried an article about the Elonex iGame this week. According to the article the mini-console with a Wii-like controller and docking station for an iPhone will retail for Â£80 and be available in HMV this week. The igamefamily.com web site appears to be a holding page at the moment (12th Aug 09) and I can't find much other mention on the interweb about it. There are six mini-games available in memory at launch, but apparently Elonex are banking on 3rd party developers to write new titles. Not sure that this is a good way to market a new console.
