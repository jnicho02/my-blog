I've come across two examples of monetisation of content recently through small chunks of content being sold for a micropayment. I wonder whether the business models are effective?

The first is GroovyMag, a magazine for groovy and grails developers that is published monthly as a pdf priced at $4.99. There has been discussion about a print-on-demand version. I guess that I support the idea of people earning money for writing professional, up-to-the-minute technical articles as I would quite like to do that myself, but I can't help thinking that I used to get all this for free.

The second is a Kindle version of an article about Using FlexBuilder for Flash Development. The 'Kindle version' says that it contains extra updated material and retails for $1.49.
