Trying to employ a new Developer? Writing a job advert? Posting on http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?jobs will get some pretty frank feedback...of course you could just read some of the past postings and glean the right and wrong way to advertise for Developers. Writing an advert should really be handled by an HR professional, but not everyone has one available. The biggest complaints seem to be that employers don't put a salary range, or forget to put the location.
