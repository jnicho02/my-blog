Over the years, i've experienced the "Swing-is-slow Witchhunt", the "Web App is best Schism", the "SWT vs Swing Holy Wars", the "use-tcl/Ruby/my tech" Riots, and lots more anti-Swing commentary. But it appears that JRoller is home to a number of Swing-ites (I would say Swing-ers but it may be taken the wrong way) or Swing-friendly posters.

I'd just like to say that i'm pleased to see you all. Swing has it's problems, but in the real-world it has many uses. Long live Swing! Let's hope that some well-placed improvements can make it new-developer friendly.
