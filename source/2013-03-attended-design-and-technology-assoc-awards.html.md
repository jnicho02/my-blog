I was exceptionally proud to be able to accompany my Mother to collect a posthumous award for my Father. My Dad, Bryan Nicholson, was one of the pioneers of Design and Technology in schools. He worked with Mike Ives whose son is Jonny Ives of Apple fame. 'Design and Technology' was really a lot about what we now call User Experience.
