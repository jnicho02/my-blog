One thing that was mentioned in a talk at the Develop Conference was the idea of seeding your code with redundant blocks. That way, you would be able to prove if someone had copied you outright or even reverse engineered. This is a common technique in mapping (the Ordnance Survey include secret, non-existent features into their maps) and in the Yellow Pages.
