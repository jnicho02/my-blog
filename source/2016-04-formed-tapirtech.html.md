I am pleased to announce that I am a Company Director again!

Following a year of remote working with the Landmark team in Exeter I was due to be recycled back to Brighton. The prospect was a bit of a backwards step, so instead I have taken a huge leap forward into the unknown. I will be working as a developer, ux designer, and/or team leader on geographical or games-related systems. I am available for hire (by the hour) and will be building my own products and services.
