​​​Ariely is a popular User Experience author who discusses how people think and what makes them act the way they do. Two things that are essential if you want to build or sell any type of product or service..so, let's face it, just 'be in business' at all.

In this book he discusses experiments that test people's ability to lie. The lie can be to others, and also to ourselves. It turns out that many people cheat, but most cheat only enough that would seem fair. If you really want to stop people cheating you have to watch them.

Whilst an interesting read, this particular book didn't seem groundbreaking.
