​Last night I went to the first Geomob of 2105 http://geomobldn.org/post/102358677210/first-geomob-of-2015-13th-january-back-at-ucl​

​​There was a strong attendance including Ed Freyfogle, Steven Feldman​​, Gary Gale, ​Giussepe Sollazzo, ​Harry Wood, Angharad Stone....These are all people you should try to bump into at a geo event as they've got lots of experience and connections with past and present geo world.

There were 6 talks. Higlights being:

* [John Snow dataset](http://blog.rtwilson.com/john-snows-cholera-data-in-more-formats/)
* Beautiful [personalised travel guide card sets](http://www.telescopecards.com/​) Each set is a one-off print run via web->Mapbox Studio->Indesign->pdf->printer
* The [London Squared Map](http://www.aftertheflood.co/projects/london-squared-map​)
* [Open Addresses](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/news/2015/01/14/UKs-first-open-and-free-address-list-launches​) launched at the Open Data Institute (ODI) in London
